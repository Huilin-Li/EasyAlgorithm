# Easy Algorithm: How to explain an algorithm to a layman. (ongoing)

I want to help you learn and understand algorithms ***as simple as possible, as less words as possible, but they must be correct and reproducible!***

Only by:
- the name of the algorithm (you will know what algorithm you will be familiar with).
- the core idea of the algorithm (you will understand the mechanism underlying the algorithm, and some of them will be given a scratch-implementation version).
- an application (you will know how to use this algorithm in one task).

### You can understand this as a tool, which help you use the algorithm in your research.
### Correct and Reproducible!

##  Neural Network
1. [This is a hand-written report that explain how the neural network works.](NN.ipynb)
    1.1 This is a comprehensive neural network tutorial that covers all aspects of the topic. 
    1.2 You only need to be familiar with +-x/ and derivative calculation.
    1.3 We will go through:
        - ***Forward propagation*** process with ***activation function (sigmoid and softmax)*** in the hidden layer and in the output layer.
        - ***Backward propagation*** process with ***derivative calculation*** and ***cross-entropy of each parameter (weight and bias)***.
        - ***Update each parameter (weight and bias) simultaneously***.
