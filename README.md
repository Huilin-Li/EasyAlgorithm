# Easy Algorithm: How to explain an algorithm to a layman.

I was asked to explain an algorithm to a layman during the interview. Hmm, this is a good question.

Here, we learn and understand an algorithm only by:

- algorithm.
- core idea.
- an example.

As simple as possible, but they must be correct!
